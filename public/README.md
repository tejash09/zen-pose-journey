# Model Files

Place the following model files in this directory:

1. `yoga_pose_classifier.onnx` - The ONNX model for yoga pose classification
2. `label_mapping.json` - JSON file containing the mapping from class indices to pose names (created automatically)

The application will load these files at runtime.
